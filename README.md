Kelly Kettle Cooler / Drippy Project

This is an experimental project and under no circumstances
are these models intended for real-life applications.  This
model collection is provided for education purposes only.

The purpose of this project is to produce 3D-printable objects
that can be used with the Kelly Kettle steam/kettle/stove 
as accessories for various purposes, for example to
attach a distillation assembly to the KK for purifying
water, or a flow adapter for directed steam application, 
and so on.
